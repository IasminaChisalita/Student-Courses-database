# Student-Courses-database

This is my first Java experience using an API and MySQL. In this program I needed https://start.spring.io to create a Maven project and to add the needed dependencies.

After finishing my code, I tested everything using Postman(http://localhost:8080) and MySQL(http://localhost:3306)

# Getting Started

First run the code and open your MySQL server.

Open your API and start adding students/courses/registrations and then verify them in your local browser by using the link + its terminal.   
      For example : http://localhost:8080/api/registrations
      
# Even more

You cand add, delete, upgrade and get informations about every entity only by using their id.
